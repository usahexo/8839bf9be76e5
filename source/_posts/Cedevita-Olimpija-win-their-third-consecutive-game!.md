#  Cedevita Olimpija win their third consecutive game!

Cedevita Olimpija registered a third consecutive victory in the 7DAYS EuroLeague Regular Season, cruising past FC Bayern Munich 103-81 at home in Zagreb. It was the first game for Cedevita since their stunning road win over Anadolu Efes Istanbul last Wednesday and head coach Veljko Mrsic had to do without starting center Ante Zizic, who is currently with the Croatian national team at the FIBA World Cup.

Despite that, Munich had no answer for the likes of Dario Saric and Bojan Bogdanovic as they led Cedevita to an early 24-10 lead after 10 minutes. The gap only widened in the second quarter, with Cedevita extending their advantage to 58-37 at halftime.

The third quarter was more even but Cedevitaâ€™s dominance was never really in doubt and they went on to win by 22 points. Bogdanovic led all scorers with 28 points while Saric added 23 and seven rebounds. For Munich, Leon Radosevic top scored with 17 points.

#  Cedevita Olimpija dominates the court against KK Krka!

In a stunning show of power and skill, Cedevita Olimpija handily defeated KK Krka yesterday by a score of 111-68. From the opening tipoff, it was clear that Cedevita was the superior team.

Led by strong performances from Dario Saric (27 points, 6 rebounds, 4 assists) and Luka Doncic (24 points, 5 rebounds, 7 assists), Cedevita never let Krka get within striking distance. The margin between the two teams just kept widening as the game went on, culminating in an impressive 43 point victory for Cedevita.

This win is a big step forward for Cedevita as they aim to compete for the championship this season. They will need to continue playing with this level of intensity if they want to stay ahead of the pack.

Cedevita were in control for most of the game, but Cibona made a late surge to make it close. However, the hosts held on for the win to get back into the playoff hunt. They are now in seventh place in the standings with a 7-9 record.

#  Cedevita Olimpija back on track with easy victory over Igokea!

Olimpija had the lead for most of the match but it was never comfortable, with the margin hovering around single digits for most of the game. Zadar refused to give up and made a late push to tie the game at 64-64 with just over two minutes remaining, but Olimpija then scored five unanswered points to seal the victory.
