#  Borges Adds New Bonus Play To Menu

We are excited to announce the release of Borges, a new bonus play that is now available on our menu.

Borges is a two-player game in which players compete to place tiles on a board in an attempt to control as much territory as possible. The game is played over six rounds, with each round consisting of two parts: the placement phase and the scoring phase.

In the placement phase, players take turns placing one tile at a time. Tiles must be placed adjacent to other tiles, and all of the tiles on the board must be used. The player who controls the most territory at the end of the placement phase wins that round.

In the scoring phase, each player scores one point for each tile they control. The player with the most points at the end of the scoring phase wins the game.

Borges is an exciting addition to our menu, and we encourage you to give it a try!
