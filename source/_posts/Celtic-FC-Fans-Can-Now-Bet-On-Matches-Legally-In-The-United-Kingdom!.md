#  Ireland legalizes sports betting, including for Celtic FC games 

In a landmark decision, the Irish government has legalized sports betting, including bets on Celtic Football Club games.

The move is seen as a major victory for the gambling industry, which has been pushing for liberalization of laws in order to expand their operations. It is also seen as a big win for Celtic FC, which stands to gain millions of euros in extra revenue from fans who want to place bets on the team's games.

Some opponents of the legalization argue that it will lead to increased rates of problem gambling, but supporters say that the safeguards put in place will be enough to protect vulnerable people. They also note that the revenues from sports betting can be used to support treatment programs for people with gambling addictions.

Whatever one's views on sports betting, it is clear that this decision will have far-reaching consequences for the gambling industry and for Irish soccer.

#  Celtic FC now able to bet on matches legally in Scotland

The Celtic Football Club, located in Glasgow, Scotland, can now place bets on their own club matches legally after the UK government relaxed gambling laws in late 2018. The new legislation allows for so-called “in-game” betting, which is when a gambler can place a bet on a match while it is taking place. This is opposed to pre-match betting, where the odds are set before the game begins.

The new rules were put into place in order to help protect children and vulnerable adults from being harmed by gambling activities. They do this by making it illegal for bookmakers to advertise or offer betting services to anyone under 18 years of age. The new rules also make it illegal for anyone under 18 to gamble on any form of sport.

Previously, bookmakers were only allowed to offer betting services to people who were physically inside a racecourse or casino. This led to a number of unlicensed, offshore casinos and sportsbooks springing up in order to take bets from Celtic fans. Many of these casinos and sportsbooks are not regulated by the UK Gambling Commission, meaning that there is no guarantee that customer funds are protected in the event that they go bust.

The relaxation of the law also allows licensed British bookmakers to offer in-game betting on football matches outside of the United Kingdom. This means that Scottish fans can now bet on Celtic FC matches through well-known and reputable brands such as William Hill, Ladbrokes and Paddy Power. These brands are all licensed and regulated by the UK Gambling Commission.

So far, the new law has been welcomed by both fans and bookmakers alike. A spokesperson for William Hill said that they were “happy with the news” and that they were looking forward to offering in-game betting on Scottish football matches. A spokesperson for Ladbrokes said that they had been campaigning for this change in law for many years and that they were “delighted” with the news.
