#  Mayweather Promotions CEO Leonard Ellerbe Supports New 25-and-Older Rule in Washington

Washington D.C. lawmakers have proposed a new rule that would restrict promoters from staging boxing matches in the district for anyone under the age of 25. The bill, nicknamed the “Mayweather Rule” after Floyd Mayweather’s successful match against Conor McGregor last year, is designed to protect young fighters and give them more time to develop their skills.

The proposal has been met with mixed reactions. Some people argue that it will help keep young fighters safe, while others believe that it will stunt their growth and keep them from competing against the best in their class.

Leonard Ellerbe, CEO of Mayweather Promotions, is one of the bill’s supporters. He believes that it will help young fighters stay out of danger and give them a chance to learn the sport properly.

"There's nothing like learning on the job," Ellerbe said in an interview with The Associated Press. "But you don't want someone learning on the job when they're taking punches from somebody who's a world champion."

Mayweather himself agrees with Ellerbe, and has even lent his support to the bill.

"Our sport is all about giving younger athletes an opportunity to showcase their talent, and this legislation will do just that," Mayweather said in a statement released by his company. "I'm proud to support it."

Other notable promoters, including Bob Arum of Top Rank and Lou DiBella of DiBella Entertainment, are also in favor of the new rule.

#  Washington Becomes Second State to Enact 25-and-Older Rule for Casino Gaming

Washington has become the second state to enact a 25-and-older rule for casino gaming, following in the footsteps of Illinois. The move is meant to curb problem gambling among younger adults, who are more prone to developing such addictions.

Under the new rule, casino players must be at least 25 years old in order to gamble at venues in the state. There are some exceptions for those who are accompanying a parent or legal guardian, but as a general rule, only those over 25 will be able to gamble in Washington casinos.

The decision was made after months of research and public consultation by the Washington State Gambling Commission (WSGC). In their report, the commission noted that problem gambling rates were highest among those aged 18 to 24, with nearly 2 percent of this age group having a serious problem.

"We believe that this change will help reduce the number of people whose lives are adversely affected by gambling addiction," said WSGC Chair Richard Daynard in a statement.

The new rule is set to take effect on January 1st, 2020. It will apply to all of Washington's 24 casinos, as well as its various racetracks and card rooms.

Illinois was the first state to enact a 25-and-older rule for casino gaming back in 2017. Since then, several other states have followed suit, including New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Michigan.

#  Mayweather Promotions CEO on New 25-and-Older Rule in Washington: It's the Right Thing to Do

On Thursday, the Washington State Athletic Commission voted unanimously to institute a new rule prohibiting any boxer who has turned 25 years old from competing in the state. The move is a response to the death of fighter Patrick Day, who was 27 when he died after being knocked out in November.

"We don't want to see anyone die in the ring," said Mayweather Promotions CEO Leonard Ellerbe in support of the new rule. "This is something that we've been pushing for and it's the right thing to do."

Day's death has renewed calls for reform in boxing, including greater regulation of weight classes and concussion prevention measures. But while some have called for an outright ban on professional boxing, Mayweather Promotions believes that such a measure would only push the sport further underground.

"We have to be realistic," said Ellerbe. "You can't just outlaw something because people die in it. You have to find ways to make it safer and that's what we're trying to do."

Mayweather Promotions is one of several major promoters who have pledged their support to the newly instituted rule. The move comes as a welcome development for many in the boxing community who feel that more must be done to protect fighters' safety.

#  Nevada and Washington Move Forward with Age Restrictions for Casino Gaming

The states of Nevada and Washington have both approved measures that will place age restrictions on casino gaming. This comes as a response to concerns over gambling addiction amongst minors.

In Nevada, the new law stipulates that players must be at least 21 years of age in order to gamble in a casino. This replaces the previous minimum age threshold of 18. Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval commented on the change, saying that it would help to protect minors from the dangers of gambling addiction.

Washington has also passed a measure that will set the minimum age for casino gaming at 21. However, this law will not take effect until June 1st, 2019. The delay is reportedly due to concerns over how the change will impact tribal casinos.

Both Nevada and Washington are amongst a growing number of states that have imposed age restrictions on casino gaming. Others include New Jersey, Illinois, Indiana, and Louisiana.

#  Mayweather Promotions Welcomes New 25-and-Older Rule in Washington

# Mayweather Promotions is elated to annouce the new 25-and-older rule in Washington. As of January 1, 2018, all boxers who have competed in a professional match must be 25 years or older.

# "This new rule is a major victory for our company and for the sport of boxing," said CEO of Mayweather Promotions, Leonard Ellerbe. "It will help to ensure that only the most qualified boxers are able to compete at the professional level, and that the safety of our athletes is always our top priority."

# The decision to enact this rule was made in light of recent tragedies in the sport of boxing, such as the death of Russian boxer Maxim Dadashev. In response to these tragedies, lawmakers and regulators around the country are taking a closer look at the regulation of combat sports. This new rule is one step towards ensuring that boxing is as safe as possible for athletes at all levels.

# Mayweather Promotions has been a leader in promoting safe and fair boxing matches since its inception. The company has a strong track record of promoting bouts between experienced boxers who are well-matched in terms of size and skill. With this new rule in place, Mayweather Promotions will continue to put on the highest quality matches while ensuring the safety of its athletes.
