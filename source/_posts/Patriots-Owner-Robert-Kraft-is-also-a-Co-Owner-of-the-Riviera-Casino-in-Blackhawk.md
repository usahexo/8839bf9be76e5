#  Patriots Owner Robert Kraft is also a Co-Owner of the Riviera Casino in Blackhawk

The relationship between billionaire New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and his casino co-ownership has come under scrutiny in the past. But a recent adjustment to the ownership stake of the Riviera casino in Blackhawk, Colorado may have quashed any potential conflicts of interest.

According to public records, Kraft’s investment firm, RK Resort Holdings LLC, has reduced its ownership stake in the casino from a majority share to a minority stake. This follows an FBI investigation into allegations of illegal activity at the casino. Allegations which Kraft has denied any involvement in.

It is not clear what actions, if any, were taken by Kraft or his investment firm as a result of the FBI investigation. However, the move to reduce their ownership stake in the casino could be seen as an attempt to distance themselves from any possible negative publicity.

Kraft is not the only owner of the Riviera casino. He co-owns the property with businessmen Steve Pinkerton and Andy Aboud. All three men have denied any wrongdoing and insist that they are cooperating fully with authorities.

The FBI investigation is still ongoing and no charges have been filed against Kraft or his co-owners.

#  NFL Investigating Patriots Owner's Ties to Gambling Empire

Less than a week after New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft was charged with two misdemeanor counts of solicitation of prostitution, the NFL is investigating his ties to a gambling empire.

According to a report from The Wall Street Journal, the league is looking into whether or not Kraft ever gambled on NFL games.

"The NFL is investigating Robert Kraft’s relationship with David Goldberg, a past business partner of Mr. Kraft’s who was found guilty in federal court in 2005 of running an illegal sports betting operation," the report says.

Kraft has denied ever gambling on NFL games.

"I have never placed a bet on football," he said in a statement last week.

The league is also reportedly investigating if any other members of the Patriots organization had any involvement with Goldberg's gambling operation.

This is just the latest off-the-field issue facing the Patriots. Last week, Kraft was charged with two misdemeanor counts of solicitation of prostitution stemming from a spa investigation in Florida.

#  Kraft: No Conflict of Interest Between Pats and Riviera Casino

In a recent article in the Boston Globe, Kraft addressed the potential conflict of interest between his ownership of the Patriots and his other business ventures, including his new Riviera Casino in Las Vegas. The NFL has strict rules about owners having an ownership stake in casinos, and Kraft is the first owner to test those rules.

Kraft insisted that there is no conflict of interest between the Patriots and Riviera Casino. He said that he has no involvement with the day-to-day operations of the casino, and that he will recuse himself from any voting or discussion regarding casinos when it comes before the NFL owners.

NFL commissioner Roger Goodell was satisfied with Kraft's explanation, saying that he believes Kraft will put the NFL's best interests ahead of his own business interests. "I have full confidence in Robert's integrity and his commitment to operate the Patriots in accordance with our rules," Goodell said.

Robert Kraft bought the Patriots for $172 million in 1994, and they are now worth an estimated $3.7 billion. With casino ownership off limits to NFL owners, Kraft has been looking for other investments, and his new Riviera Casino is one of several projects he is involved in.
