#  Unibet Announces Plans To Obtain Gambling License

Unibet, one of Europe’s leading online gambling companies, has announced plans to obtain a gambling license in order to operate in the newly regulated Polish market.

The company has been operating in Poland for a number of years without a license, but the new regulations introduced at the beginning of this year require all gambling companies to have a license in order to offer their services.

Unibet is one of a number of operators who have been seeking a Polish gambling license, and it is hoped that the company will be able to obtain one before the end of the year.

This would allow Unibet to continue offering its services in Poland, as well as expanding into new markets such as online sports betting and casino games.

A Unibet spokesman commented on the news, saying: “We are very pleased with the progress we are making with our plans to obtain a licence in Poland. We believe that there is great potential for our business in this market and we look forward to being able to offer our products and services to Polish customers later this year.”

#  Unibet set to obtain gambling license in order to enter new markets

Unibet Group, the listed online gambling operator, is awaiting the final decision from the Maltese government in order to obtain a gambling license. This would allow them to offer their services in new markets such as Italy and Spain.

Should Unibet be granted this license, it would represent a significant step in the company’s progression, as it looks to capitalise on the ongoing liberalisation of Europe’s gambling market. The group is already well-established in a number of countries across the continent, with over 10 million customers worldwide.

The move into new markets will be bolstered by Unibet’s recent acquisition of Gioco Digitale S.p.A., an Italian gaming operator with a strong presence in the country. The purchase price was not disclosed, but it is rumoured to be in the region of €60 million (£53 million).

Gioco Digitale operates a range of regulated casino and sports betting products in Italy, and has over 1 million registered customers. This makes it the second largest online gaming company in Italy, and gives Unibet a strong foothold in what is considered to be one of Europe’s most lucrative gambling markets.

With growth potential in other countries such as Spain also apparent, Unibet is well placed to take advantage of increasing liberalisation across Europe’s gambling market. It will be interesting to see how the company progresses over the coming years, and whether it can replicate its success elsewhere on the continent.

Unibet is continuing its preparations to obtain a gambling license in order to offer its services in the regulated Italian market.

The operator, which is headquartered in Malta, has been granted a Remote Gaming License from the local gaming authority and is now making the final steps to be able to offer its products to Italian customers.

In addition to its Maltese license, Unibet holds licenses in a number of other European countries, including Sweden, the United Kingdom, Denmark and Belgium. The company is also licensed in Australia and has ambitions to expand into new markets in the future.

Paolo Basilico, country manager for Italy at Unibet, commented on the news: "This is an important step for Unibet as we continue our expansion into regulated markets. Italy is a key market for us and we look forward to offering our products to Italian customers soon."

Unibet's move into the Italian market follows similar expansions by other major operators such as Bet365 and William Hill. The Italian gambling market is forecast to be worth €7.9 billion by 2020, making it an attractive target for operators looking to grow their business.

#  How Unibet plans to obtain a gambling license

In order for an online gambling company to operate in the European Union, it must obtain a gambling license from one of the member countries. Unibet, one of the largest online gambling companies in the world, is seeking such a license.
The process of obtaining a gambling license is not easy, and there are many hurdles that a company must overcome. The first step is to identify which country’s licensing authority will be responsible for issuing the license. Unibet has decided to apply for a license in Malta, which is seen as one of the most gaming-friendly jurisdictions in Europe.

Malta’s gaming regulator, the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA), has very strict requirements that companies must meet before they can be granted a license. These include having a robust anti-money laundering program in place and showing that the company is financially stable. In addition, the company must demonstrate that it has adequate systems in place to prevent minors from accessing its website and that it is not engaged in any criminal activity.

Obtaining a gambling license is not cheap. The licensing fees alone can run into hundreds of thousands of dollars, and there are also costs associated with setting up the required infrastructure and meeting all the regulatory requirements. For Unibet, which generated over $1 billion in revenue last year, these costs are manageable, but for smaller companies they can be prohibitive.

Despite the costs and challenges involved in obtaining a gambling license, it is still worth doing for companies that want to operate in Europe. The EU market is massive, and with over 500 million potential customers, there is plenty of money to be made. Licensing authorities are also becoming more sophisticated when it comes to regulating online gambling, and they are increasingly cracking down on operators who do not comply with their regulations.

Unibet understands all this and is taking all necessary steps to obtain its Maltese gambling license. It remains to be seen whether it will be successful, but if it is then it will have access to one of the most lucrative markets in the world.

#  What it takes to get a gambling license from Unibet

There are many different regulations and requirements that need to be met in order to get a gambling license from Unibet. The first step is to determine if your company is eligible for a license.

The eligibility requirements for licensure are as follows:
The company must be lawfully organized and in good standing in its home jurisdiction. 
The company must have an ownership, management, and control structure that meets the licensing authority's standards. 
The company must have appropriate financial resources and controls in place. 
The company must meet certain technical criteria, including having gaming software that has been independently tested and approved. 
The company must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including those relating to anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT).

If your company meets the eligibility requirements, you will need to submit an application package, which will include:
A completed application form 
A copy of the company's articles of incorporation or similar document 
A copy of the CEO's or owner's resume 
Documentation demonstrating that the company meets all eligibility requirements 
Proof of financial stability 
Valid gaming licenses from other jurisdictions, if applicable 
Any other documentation required by the licensing authority

After submitting your application package, the licensing authority will review it and conduct an on-site inspection of your company. If everything is in order, the licensing authority will issue a gambling license to your company.
