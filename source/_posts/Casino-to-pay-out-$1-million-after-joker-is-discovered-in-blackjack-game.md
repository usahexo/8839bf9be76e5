#  Casino to pay out $1 million after joker is discovered in blackjack game

Casino officials in Atlantic City, NJ announced this week that they will pay out a total of $1 million to gamblers after a joker was discovered in a blackjack game. The casino has stated that it is their policy to pay out any winning bets when there is evidence of tampering with the game.

The discovery of the joker came about as a result of an ongoing investigation into suspected cheating by one or more casino employees. So far, no arrests have been made, but the investigation is ongoing.

In a statement released by the casino, they said "We take player protection seriously and will always pay out legitimate wins. We are cooperating fully with the New Jersey Gaming Enforcement Division on their investigation and hope to identify the person or persons responsible as soon as possible."

The Atlantic City casino payout is just the latest in a long line of such incidents. In 2012, a blackjack player at the Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh won $1.2 million dollars after discovering that his cards had been switched. And in 2014, an Ontario man won over $300,000 from Casino Niagara after finding that his cards had been marked.

While these kinds of payouts are rare, they are not unheard of. In fact, according to gaming experts, casinos in North America pay out millions of dollars each year to disgruntled players who have been cheated out of their rightful winnings.

#  Woman wins big with joker at blackjack table in Guam casino 

Makiko Suzuki, a woman visiting from Japan, visited the blackjack tables at Guam’s largest casino and hit the jackpot-literally. Suzuki was playing with a $10 bet when she was dealt a joker, which automatically pays out at 10 to 1 odds. This turned her $10 bet into a $100 pay out, much to the delight of the other players at the table.

This lucky win comes as a bit of a respite for Suzuki, who was mourning the death of her mother only days before her trip to Guam. “It’s such a happy thing that happened to me at this time,” said Suzuki in an interview translated by ABC News. “After my mother’s death, I thought nothing happy would happen to me again, but this casino adventure has made me so happy.”

Luck obviously seems to be on Suzuki’s side, as this is not the first time she has won big in a casino. In fact, Suzuki reportedly took home around $7000 after playing roulette earlier in her trip. We can only hope that Lady Luck will continue to smile on Suzuki as she continues her gambling adventures!

A joker found in a deck of cards during a game of blackjack at the Margarita Princess Resort and Casino in Guam is worth $100,000, according to the casino.

The joker was discovered by 19-year-old dealer Joby Quichocho as he was shuffling the cards on Monday evening.

"As soon as I saw it, I knew it was special," Quichocho said. "It's like finding a diamond in the rough."

According to casino officials, the joker is the first of its kind to be found in Guam and is only the second known to exist in the world. The first was discovered in Germany in 1988.

Quichocho said he plans to keep the joker and frame it.
