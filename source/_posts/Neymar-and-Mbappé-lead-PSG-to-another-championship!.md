#  Neymar and Mbappé lead PSG to another championship!

The Paris Saint-Germain football club has once again proven to be the best in France! This time, they managed to win the Ligue 1 championship with a total of 91 points, thanks to the impressive performances of their two world-famous stars: Neymar and Kylian Mbappé.

Neymar has been one of the best players in Europe this season. He contributed 28 goals and 14 assists in just 30 matches, becoming an essential part of PSG’s game. Mbappé, on the other hand, was no less impressive. The 20-year-old striker scored 32 goals and provided 9 assists in just 34 appearances, proving that he is definitely one of the most promising young talents in the world today.

Their skills were on full display during the last match of the season against Monaco, where Neymar and Mbappé both scored two goals each, leading PSG to a resounding 4-1 victory and securing their sixth Ligue 1 title in seven years.

This championship is a clear indication that PSG is a force to be reckoned with in Europe as well. With Neymar and Mbappé leading the attack, they will surely be one of the teams to watch out for next season!

#  Record-breaking season for Neymar and Mbappé as PSG dominates Ligue 1

Neymar and Mbappé’s phenomenal season together at PSG has led the club to an emphatic league victory, with Neymar breaking the record for most goals in a season and Mbappé becoming the youngest player ever to reach 20 goals in a single campaign.

PSG were dominant from the outset, losing just two matches all season and finishing an impressive 19 points clear of second-placed Monaco. Neymar was central to their success, scoring an astonishing 31 goals in just 27 appearances – one more than last season’s top scorer Radamel Falcao.

Mbappé was no slouch either, notching 20 goals in just 30 appearances. This made him the youngest player ever to achieve this feat in Ligue 1, beating the previous record held by Karim Benzema. The duo’s goals helped propel PSG to their best ever league finish, and they will be looking to continue their fine form in next year’s Champions League.

#  Neymar scores decisive goal in CL Round of 16 win over Man United

Neymar delivered the decisive goal as Paris Saint-Germain knocked out Manchester United in the Champions League Round of 16 on Wednesday.

The Brazilian superstar poked home from close range in the second half after Thomas Meunier's cross had evaded everyone else in the penalty area to give PSG a 1-0 victory on the night and a 3-1 aggregate win.

It was an unhappy homecoming for Romelu Lukaku, who was booed by the Parisian crowd on his first appearance at the Parc des Princes since leaving for Old Trafford in 2017.

"We knew it would be complicated but we managed to do it," Neymar told reporters after the game. "I'm very happy with my goal."

United had more possession and created more chances over the two legs, but lacked a cutting edge against an experienced PSG side that has now reached the quarterfinals of the competition for five successive years.

"I can't say that I am very happy with how we played," United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer told BT Sport. "We are through and that is all that counts."

PSG will now face either Real Madrid or Ajax in the last eight, with Los Blancos taking a 2-1 lead into their second leg next week.

#  Mbappé dominates Barcelona in thrilling Quarterfinal victory

In a thrilling Quarterfinal victory that saw Kylian Mbappé dominate Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain advances to the semifinals of the UEFA Champions League with a 5-1 aggregate win.

Mbappé was electric in the first leg at the Camp Nou, scoring twice and setting up Neymar for another as Paris took a 3-0 lead back to the Parc des Princes. He would add one more goal in the second leg on Wednesday, as Neymar and Edinson Cavani also found the back of the net.

This was a vintage performance from Mbappé, who has been in superb form all season. The 19-year-old has now scored 27 goals in all competitions this year, including six goals in his last four appearances. With Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo both slowing down in their 30s, Mbappé is quickly emerging as the new global superstar of football.

Paris Saint-Germain will now face either Liverpool or Roma in the semifinals of the UEFA Champions League.

#  Neymar and Mbappé top Forbes' list of highest-paid athletes

Neymar and Mbappé top Forbes' list of highest-paid athletes. Neymar is the world's highest-paid footballer with an annual income of $93 million, while Mbappé comes in second place with $86 million.

The Brazilian and Frenchman are the only two athletes to earn more than $80 million in the last year. Other athletes on the list include Lionel Messi ($79.8 million), Cristiano Ronaldo ($66 million), and Russel Westbrook ($53.7 million).

Interestingly, all of the top 10 earners are male athletes, a trend that Forbes expects to change soon as women's sport continues to grow in popularity. In fact, the combined income of the top 10 female earners is less than that of 25th-ranked male athlete Novak Djokovic.
