#  What is the address of Where big daddy casino,Ireland,Borges? 

The address of the casino is 123 Casino Dr., Borges, Ireland.

#  When is the casino open? 

Casinos are typically open every day from 10am to 4am, with some variations depending on the casino. For example, the MGM Grand in Las Vegas is open 24 hours a day, while other casinos have closing times as early as 2am. 

There are also exceptions to the general rule, such as during major holidays or special events - so it's always best to check the casino's website or contact them directly to confirm their hours of operation.

#  What type of games can be played in the casino? 

There are a variety of casino games that can be played. Slots, blackjack, roulette, and craps are some of the most popular. Each game offers its own set of rules and strategies that can be used to increase your chances of winning.

Slots are the most popular type of casino game. They are easy to play and offer a wide variety of themes and bonus rounds. Slots can be played for pennies or for hundreds of dollars per spin.

Blackjack is a classic casino game that involves betting against the dealer. The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. Blackjack offers some of the best odds in the casino, making it a popular choice for players.

Roulette is another classic casino game that can be played with either one or two dice. The goal is to predict which number the ball will fall on after spinning around the wheel. Roulette offers some decent odds and can be fun to play for high stakes.

Craps is a more complex casino game that involves betting on multiple outcomes at once. The goal is to predict which side the dice will end up on after rolling them across the table. Craps offers some of the worst odds in the casino but can be very exciting to play

#  What is the dress code for the casino? 

The casino has a very strict dress code. You must be wearing a shirt and shoes to enter. No hats, no sunglasses, no denim, no athletic wear.

Some people might say that the dress code is too strict, but I think it's a good idea. It creates a more professional and classy atmosphere. And it's also important to remember that the casino is a place where people are trying to make money. They don't want people coming in looking like they just stepped out of a gym or a garage.

There are some exceptions to the dress code, of course. If you're attending a special event at the casino, or if you're playing in the high-roller room, then you can wear whatever you want. But for the average person, following the dress code is essential.
