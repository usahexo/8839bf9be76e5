#  How to get unlimited double money and chips in Diamond Casino Resort on PS4

There are a few ways to get unlimited double money and chips in Diamond Casino Resort on PS4. One way is to use exploits such as the one found by YouTuber ‘MuhammadA786’. The exploit allows you to keep earning rewards like money and chips over and over again.

To do this, you will need to first head to the Roulette table in Diamond Casino Resort on PS4. Once there, press square to start a game, then immediately quit out of it. Next, head over to the poker table in Diamond Casino Resort, and press square again to start a game. Again, quit out of it as soon as it starts.

Now, go back to the Roulette table, and you should still have the option to play again. Press square to start the game, but this time don’t quit out of it – let it finish. Once the game is over, you will have won some money and chips. Now, just repeat the process over and over again to get unlimited rewards!

Another way to get unlimited double money and chips in Diamond Casino Resort on PS4 is by using a glitch known as the ‘duplication glitch’. This glitch allows you to duplicate any amount of money or chips that you want. To do this, you will need two controllers.

First, make sure that both controllers are signed into your PSN account. Then, head over to Diamond Casino Resort on PS4 and enter into a game of Roulette with both controllers. Once you’re in the game, hold down X on controller 1 and quickly press triangle on controller 2 (this will duplicate the bet). Keep doing this until you have enough money or chips – whichever one you want!
