founded Furman Rugby America","date":"2022-08-17T17:02:09.000Z","_content":"\n\n#  Who founded Furman Rugby America? \n\nThe Furman Rugby America team was founded in 2009 by Nic Lasher. His goal was to provide a competitive outlet for the college’s students, and the team has certainly accomplished that.\n\nFurman has enjoyed a great deal of success in its short history, thanks in large part to Coach Lasher’s leadership. The club has captured the Southern Conference Championship three times (2011, 2013, and 2016) and finished as runner-up twice (2012 and 2015). They have also fared well in national tournaments, earning a spot in the prestigious D1A National Championship Tournament twice (2013 and 2016). \n\nThis past season was arguably Furman’s best yet. The Paladins went undefeated in conference play, winning their fourth consecutive Southern Conference Championship. They then capped off their season with a trip to the D1A National Championship Tournament where they reached the semifinal round. \n\nCoach Lasher and his team have built Furman Rugby into one of America’s top collegiate rugby programs, and they show no signs of slowing down anytime soon.\n\n#  What are the Furman Rugby America colors? \n\nThe Furman Rugby America colors are white and green.\n\n#  What is the Furman Rugby America logo?\n\nThe Furman Rugby America logo is a simple, yet elegant design that incorporates the university’s Paladins mascot and blue and white colors. The logo was designed by graphic artist Carlton Wilder and first used in the early 1990s. The key elements of the logo are a shield with a paladin on horseback in the center, flanked by two rugby balls. The inscription “Furman Rugby America” is at the top of the shield, and “Paladins” is at the bottom.\n\nThe origins of the Furman Rugby America logo can be traced back to when rugby began to gain popularity on college campuses across the United States in the late 1980s. As rugby began to grow in popularity, universities started to create their own teams and develop their own logos. Furman University was no exception, and in 1990 they created a rugby team and commissioned graphic artist Carlton Wilder to create a logo for them.\n\nThe original version of the logo had a more intricate design, with a scrollwork border around the shield and a banner across the top with “Furman Rugby America” written on it. The paladin on horseback was also more detailed, with full armor and a flowing cape. However, over time this version of the logo began to be seen as too busy and was eventually replaced with the simpler design that is used today.\n\nDespite its simplicity, the Furman Rugby America logo has become one of the most recognized logos in collegiate rugby circles. It has been used extensively by Furman University both on their website and social media pages, as well as on merchandise such as T-shirts and hats. The Paladins have also used it on their playing jerseys, making it one of only a handful of American university rugby teams to do so.\n\n#  What is the Furman Rugby America mission? \n\n# The Furman Rugby America mission is to better the community through the sport of rugby. \n\nThe Furman Rugby America team was founded in 2013 as part of an effort to give back to the Greenville community. The team’s mission is to use the sport of rugby as a vehicle to make a positive impact on the lives of others. Whether it’s working with local schools or charities, the team is committed to using rugby as a way to help others. \n\nIn addition to its work in the Greenville community, the Furman Rugby America team also participates in tournaments across the country. The team has had success on the field, winning several tournaments and national championships. But more important than wins and losses is the work that the team does off of the field. The Furman Rugby America team is a force for good in the world, and it looks forward to making an even bigger impact in the years to come.\n\n#  What are the Furman Rugby America sponsors?\n\nThe Furman Rugby America sponsors are a group of businesses and organizations that have partnered with the Furman rugby program to provide financial and other support. The sponsors are critical to the success of the team, and their contributions help to offset some of the program's costs.\n\nSome of the largest contributors are title sponsor Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, as well as presenting sponsor MillerCoors Brewing Company. Other notable sponsors include Under Armour, KPMG, Ortho Carolina, and GE Healthcare. These companies all recognize the importance of developing leaders on and off the field, and they support Furman rugby as a means of achieving this goal.\n\nThe sponsorship program provides much-needed financial assistance to the team, but it also offers many other benefits.

His goal was to provide a competitive outlet for the college’s students, and the team has certainly accomplished that.\n\nFurman has enjoyed a great deal of success in its short history, thanks in large part to Coach Lasher’s leadership. The club has captured the Southern Conference Championship three times (2011, 2013, and 2016) and finished as runner-up twice (2012 and 2015). They have also fared well in national tournaments, earning a spot in the prestigious D1A National Championship Tournament twice (2013 and 2016). \n\nThis past season was arguably Furman’s best yet.

The logo was designed by graphic artist Carlton Wilder and first used in the early 1990s. The key elements of the logo are a shield with a paladin on horseback in the center, flanked by two rugby balls. The inscription “Furman Rugby America” is at the top of the shield, and “Paladins” is at the bottom.\n\nThe origins of the Furman Rugby America logo can be traced back to when rugby began to gain popularity on college campuses across the United States in the late 1980s. As rugby began to grow in popularity, universities started to create their own teams and develop their own logos. Furman University was no exception, and in 1990 they created a rugby team and commissioned graphic artist Carlton Wilder to create a logo for them.\n\nThe original version of the logo had a more intricate design, with a scrollwork border around the shield and a banner across the top with “Furman Rugby America” written on it. The paladin on horseback was also more detailed, with full armor and a flowing cape. However, over time this version of the logo began to be seen as too busy and was eventually replaced with the simpler design that is used today.\n\nDespite its simplicity, the Furman Rugby America logo has become one of the most recognized logos in collegiate rugby circles. It has been used extensively by Furman University both on their website and social media pages, as well as on merchandise such as T-shirts and hats. The Paladins have also used it on their playing jerseys, making it one of only a handful of American university rugby teams to do so.\n\n#  What is the Furman Rugby America mission? \n\n# The Furman Rugby America mission is to better the community through the sport of rugby. \n\nThe Furman Rugby America team was founded in 2013 as part of an effort to give back to the Greenville community. The team’s mission is to use the sport of rugby as a vehicle to make a positive impact on the lives of others. Whether it’s working with local schools or charities, the team is committed to using rugby as a way to help others. \n\nIn addition to its work in the Greenville community, the Furman Rugby America team also participates in tournaments across the country. The team has had success on the field, winning several tournaments and national championships. But more important than wins and losses is the work that the team does off of the field. The Furman Rugby America team is a force for good in the world, and it looks forward to making an even bigger impact in the years to come.\n\n#  What are the Furman Rugby America sponsors?\n\nThe Furman Rugby America sponsors are a group of businesses and organizations that have partnered with the Furman rugby program to provide financial and other support. The sponsors are critical to the success of the team, and their contributions help to offset some of the program's costs.\n\nSome of the largest contributors are title sponsor Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, as well as presenting sponsor MillerCoors Brewing Company. Other notable sponsors include Under Armour, KPMG, Ortho Carolina, and GE Healthcare. These companies all recognize the importance of developing leaders on and off the field, and they support Furman rugby as a means of achieving this goal.\n\nThe sponsorship program provides much-needed financial assistance to the team, but it also offers many other benefits.

Many people are wondering when this new form of entertainment will start to change things on the island. The answer is that it is already happening.\n\nThere are several ways that the online casino car is impacting Bermuda. One of the most obvious ways is that it is bringing in much-needed revenue to the island. The government is able to collect taxes on the income that is generated by the casino car, and this helps to fund important programs and services.\n\nIn addition, the online casino car is creating jobs on Bermuda. This is important, as it helps to support the local economy. It also provides opportunities for people who are looking for work. Finally, the online casino car is helping to attract tourists to Bermuda. This influx of visitors helps to support local businesses and create jobs in the tourism industry.\n\nOverall, it is clear that the online casino car is having a positive impact on Bermuda. It is bringing in much-needed revenue, creating jobs, and attracting tourists. This is good news for the island, and it looks like things are only going to continue to improve in the years ahead.\n\n#  What is the process of changing the online casino car in Bermuda?\n\nAll casinos in Bermuda must be licensed by the Bermuda Gaming Commission. The licensing process is strict and involves a number of requirements, including that the casino must be legitimately owned and operated. \n\nThe casino car must also meet certain physical requirements, such as being situated on a property that is at least 10,000 square feet in size. It is also required that the casino have a minimum of 75 gaming devices, which can include slot machines, table games, and poker tables. In order to offer sports betting, the casino must also have an area that is at least 2,500 square feet in size.\n\nThe Bermuda Gaming Commission reviews all applications for a casino license and will not issue a license if it believes that the operation would not be in the best interests of the island’s residents. The commission has the authority to revoke or suspend a casino license if it determines that the operator is not in compliance with its regulations or if it believes that the casino is having a negative impact on the community.\n\n#  Why is it necessary to change the online casino car in Bermuda?\n\nThere are a number of reasons why it might be necessary to change the online casino car in Bermuda. One possibility is that the existing car is no longer capable of meeting the needs of the casino. Perhaps it's not performing well enough or it's no longer reliable. In this case, it may be necessary to find a new car that can handle the demands of the job.\n\nAnother possibility is that the casino wants to update its image and believes that a new car will help to achieve this goal. Maybe the old car is too flashy or doesn't match the style of the new casino. In this case, it may make sense to choose a more subtle option for the new car.\n\nFinally, there could be legal reasons why it's necessary to change the online casino car in Bermuda. For example, if the casino is expanding into new territory, it may be required to use a different type of car in order to meet local regulations. Whatever the reasoning behind the change, it's important to make sure that all aspects of the process are handled correctly. This includes choosing the right car and making sure that it's properly fitted for the needs of the casino.\n\n#  What are the benefits of changing the online casino car in Bermuda?\n\nThere are several benefits of changing the online casino car in Bermuda. The first is that it will help to create a more level playing field for businesses on the island. Right now, the online casino car is owned by two companies, and this gives them a significant advantage over other businesses. By changing the online casino car, the government can help to ensure that all businesses have an equal chance to compete and succeed.\n\nAnother benefit of changing the online casino car is that it will help to create new jobs on the island. The two companies that currently own the online casino car have significantly reduced their staff over the past few years. By opening up the market to other businesses, more jobs will be created and this will help to improve the economy on Bermuda.\n\nFinally, changing the online casino car will help to increase tourism on Bermuda. Right now, there are very few tourists who visit Bermuda specifically to gamble. By opening up the market to other businesses, more tourists will be attracted to the island and this will help to boost the economy on Bermuda.\n\n#  How often does the online casino car need to be changed in Bermuda?\n\nThe online casino car in Bermuda needs to be changed approximately every two years. This is due to the high levels of humidity and salt in the air, both of which can damage the car.","source":"_posts/When-does-the-online-casino-car-change-Bermuda.md","raw":"---\ntitle: When does the online casino car change Bermuda\ndate: 2022-10-05 13:17:15\ncategories:\n- Online Casino\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  When does the online casino car change Bermuda?\n\nThe online casino car has come to Bermuda, and it is changing the island in a lot of ways.

It is also required that the casino have a minimum of 75 gaming devices, which can include slot machines, table games, and poker tables. In order to offer sports betting, the casino must also have an area that is at least 2,500 square feet in size.</p>\n<p>The Bermuda Gaming Commission reviews all applications for a casino license and will not issue a license if it believes that the operation would not be in the best interests of the island’s residents.

If you're looking to have a good time without spending too much money, then you need to know how much money to take with you.\n\nIn general, you'll want to take around $100-$200 with you to the casino. This will give you enough money to play some games and maybe even win some cash. If you're lucky, you could walk away with a few hundred dollars in your pocket.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that gambling is a risky proposition. You could end up losing all of your money, so it's important to budget accordingly. If you're not comfortable risking that much money, then you may want to take less with you.\n\nWhatever amount of money you choose to take, make sure that it's something that you're comfortable losing. Gambling can be a lot of fun, but it's important to remember that it's still gambling and there is always the potential for loss.\n\n#  How Much Money to Take to Casino for a Chance of Winning Big\n\nSo, how much money is enough to take to a casino in order to have a chance of winning big? The answer, of course, depends on the individual. Someone who is comfortable risking more money might decide to bring a larger sum, while someone who wants to play it safe may opt for a smaller amount.\n\nThat said, there are some general guidelines that can help make this decision. First, it's important to remember that the odds of winning at a casino are not in the player's favor. In fact, the house edge ranges from 1% to 10%, which means that over time the casino will come out ahead. This is why it's crucial to only risk money that can be afford to lose.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the type of game you want to play. Slot machines typically have the worst odds, while blackjack and other table games offer better chances of winning. So if your goal is to walk away with more money than you came with, table games are probably your best bet.\n\nWith all that in mind, here are some ballpark estimates for how much money you might want to bring:\n\n● $100-$300 for slot machines\n● $500-$1,000 for blackjack and other table games\n\n#  How Much Money to Take to Casino for a Chance of Winning Even More!\n\nIn any casino, there are games that give players a better chance of winning than others. If you're looking to up your chances of walking away with more money, then you should consider playing one of these games. In this article, we'll take a look at how much money to take to casino for a chance of winning even more!\n\n# Roulette\n\nRoulette is one of the best games to play in a casino if you're looking to win more money. This is because the odds are stacked in favour of the house, which means that the player has a lower chance of winning. However, with a bit of luck, you could walk away with more cash than you started with. When playing roulette, it's important to remember that you can increase your chances of winning by betting on multiple numbers. By doing so, you'll reduce the amount of money you could lose if the ball lands on a different number than the one you've chosen.\n\n# Blackjack\n\nBlackjack is another game that offers players a better chance of winning than some of the other casino games. This is because there is some skill involved in blackjack and it's not simply down to luck. With a bit of practice, you could become a blackjack master and improve your chances of winning significantly. When playing blackjack, it's important to remember that you can decrease your losses by sticking to basic strategy. If you do this, then you'll be less likely to lose all your money in one go!\n\n#  How Much Money to Take to Casino and Come Out Ahead\n\nCrazy as it may seem, there are people out there that manage to lose money while gambling in a casino. At the same time, there are those who make a fortune from it. How can somebody walk in with $100 and leave with less money than when they arrived? With some sound advice and preparation, you can be one of the lucky ones who walks away a winner!\n\nThe first piece of advice is to know your limits. If you're not comfortable risking a certain amount of money, then don't. There's no need to put yourself in a difficult financial situation by gambling with more money than you're willing to lose. Start small and work your way up as you become more comfortable with the game.\n\nAnother important piece of advice is to choose the right games. Not all games offer the same odds, and some are much harder to win than others. Table games like blackjack and roulette offer better odds than popular slot machines. If you're looking to win big, these are the games to play.\n\nIt's also important to be aware of the house edge on each game. This is the percentage of each bet that the casino takes in return for hosting the game. For example, blackjack has a house edge of around 1%, while slot machines have a house edge of around 10%. By choosing games with lower house edges, you're putting yourself in a better position to come out ahead.\n\nFinally, make sure you have enough money to last throughout your visit.

If you're looking to have a good time without spending too much money, then you need to know how much money to take with you.\n\nIn general, you'll want to take around $100-$200 with you to the casino. This will give you enough money to play some games and maybe even win some cash. If you're lucky, you could walk away with a few hundred dollars in your pocket.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that gambling is a risky proposition. You could end up losing all of your money, so it's important to budget accordingly. If you're not comfortable risking that much money, then you may want to take less with you.\n\nWhatever amount of money you choose to take, make sure that it's something that you're comfortable losing. Gambling can be a lot of fun, but it's important to remember that it's still gambling and there is always the potential for loss.\n\n#  How Much Money to Take to Casino for a Chance of Winning Big\n\nSo, how much money is enough to take to a casino in order to have a chance of winning big? The answer, of course, depends on the individual. Someone who is comfortable risking more money might decide to bring a larger sum, while someone who wants to play it safe may opt for a smaller amount.\n\nThat said, there are some general guidelines that can help make this decision. First, it's important to remember that the odds of winning at a casino are not in the player's favor. In fact, the house edge ranges from 1% to 10%, which means that over time the casino will come out ahead. This is why it's crucial to only risk money that can be afford to lose.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the type of game you want to play. Slot machines typically have the worst odds, while blackjack and other table games offer better chances of winning. So if your goal is to walk away with more money than you came with, table games are probably your best bet.\n\nWith all that in mind, here are some ballpark estimates for how much money you might want to bring:\n\n● $100-$300 for slot machines\n● $500-$1,000 for blackjack and other table games\n\n#  How Much Money to Take to Casino for a Chance of Winning Even More!\n\nIn any casino, there are games that give players a better chance of winning than others. If you're looking to up your chances of walking away with more money, then you should consider playing one of these games. In this article, we'll take a look at how much money to take to casino for a chance of winning even more!\n\n# Roulette\n\nRoulette is one of the best games to play in a casino if you're looking to win more money. This is because the odds are stacked in favour of the house, which means that the player has a lower chance of winning. However, with a bit of luck, you could walk away with more cash than you started with. When playing roulette, it's important to remember that you can increase your chances of winning by betting on multiple numbers. By doing so, you'll reduce the amount of money you could lose if the ball lands on a different number than the one you've chosen.\n\n# Blackjack\n\nBlackjack is another game that offers players a better chance of winning than some of the other casino games. This is because there is some skill involved in blackjack and it's not simply down to luck. With a bit of practice, you could become a blackjack master and improve your chances of winning significantly. When playing blackjack, it's important to remember that you can decrease your losses by sticking to basic strategy. If you do this, then you'll be less likely to lose all your money in one go!\n\n#  How Much Money to Take to Casino and Come Out Ahead\n\nCrazy as it may seem, there are people out there that manage to lose money while gambling in a casino. At the same time, there are those who make a fortune from it. How can somebody walk in with $100 and leave with less money than when they arrived? With some sound advice and preparation, you can be one of the lucky ones who walks away a winner!\n\nThe first piece of advice is to know your limits. If you're not comfortable risking a certain amount of money, then don't. There's no need to put yourself in a difficult financial situation by gambling with more money than you're willing to lose. Start small and work your way up as you become more comfortable with the game.\n\nAnother important piece of advice is to choose the right games. Not all games offer the same odds, and some are much harder to win than others. Table games like blackjack and roulette offer better odds than popular slot machines. If you're looking to win big, these are the games to play.\n\nIt's also important to be aware of the house edge on each game. This is the percentage of each bet that the casino takes in return for hosting the game. For example, blackjack has a house edge of around 1%, while slot machines have a house edge of around 10%. By choosing games with lower house edges, you're putting yourself in a better position to come out ahead.\n\nFinally, make sure you have enough money to last throughout your visit. Don't go into a casino expecting to win your money back and then some - that's just not likely to happen. Plan on losing some rounds, and have extra cash on hand just in case. That way, you won't end up frantically trying to dig up more bills every time you run out of funds.\n\nWith some planning and discipline, you can make Casino gambling work in your favor - rather then against it!\n\n#  Time to Gamble: How Much Money to Take to Casino\n\nWhen it comes to gambling, there are a lot of different opinions on how much money to take to casino.

The bill, nicknamed the “Mayweather Rule” after Floyd Mayweather’s successful match against Conor McGregor last year, is designed to protect young fighters and give them more time to develop their skills.\n\nThe proposal has been met with mixed reactions. Some people argue that it will help keep young fighters safe, while others believe that it will stunt their growth and keep them from competing against the best in their class.\n\nLeonard Ellerbe, CEO of Mayweather Promotions, is one of the bill’s supporters. He believes that it will help young fighters stay out of danger and give them a chance to learn the sport properly.\n\n\"There's nothing like learning on the job,\" Ellerbe said in an interview with The Associated Press. \"But you don't want someone learning on the job when they're taking punches from somebody who's a world champion.\"\n\nMayweather himself agrees with Ellerbe, and has even lent his support to the bill.\n\n\"Our sport is all about giving younger athletes an opportunity to showcase their talent, and this legislation will do just that,\" Mayweather said in a statement released by his company. \"I'm proud to support it.\"\n\nOther notable promoters, including Bob Arum of Top Rank and Lou DiBella of DiBella Entertainment, are also in favor of the new rule.\n\n#  Washington Becomes Second State to Enact 25-and-Older Rule for Casino Gaming\n\nWashington has become the second state to enact a 25-and-older rule for casino gaming, following in the footsteps of Illinois. The move is meant to curb problem gambling among younger adults, who are more prone to developing such addictions.\n\nUnder the new rule, casino players must be at least 25 years old in order to gamble at venues in the state. There are some exceptions for those who are accompanying a parent or legal guardian, but as a general rule, only those over 25 will be able to gamble in Washington casinos.\n\nThe decision was made after months of research and public consultation by the Washington State Gambling Commission (WSGC). In their report, the commission noted that problem gambling rates were highest among those aged 18 to 24, with nearly 2 percent of this age group having a serious problem.\n\n\"We believe that this change will help reduce the number of people whose lives are adversely affected by gambling addiction,\" said WSGC Chair Richard Daynard in a statement.\n\nThe new rule is set to take effect on January 1st, 2020. It will apply to all of Washington's 24 casinos, as well as its various racetracks and card rooms.\n\nIllinois was the first state to enact a 25-and-older rule for casino gaming back in 2017. Since then, several other states have followed suit, including New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Michigan.\n\n#  Mayweather Promotions CEO on New 25-and-Older Rule in Washington: It's the Right Thing to Do\n\nOn Thursday, the Washington State Athletic Commission voted unanimously to institute a new rule prohibiting any boxer who has turned 25 years old from competing in the state. The move is a response to the death of fighter Patrick Day, who was 27 when he died after being knocked out in November.\n\n\"We don't want to see anyone die in the ring,\" said Mayweather Promotions CEO Leonard Ellerbe in support of the new rule. \"This is something that we've been pushing for and it's the right thing to do.\"\n\nDay's death has renewed calls for reform in boxing, including greater regulation of weight classes and concussion prevention measures. But while some have called for an outright ban on professional boxing, Mayweather Promotions believes that such a measure would only push the sport further underground.\n\n\"We have to be realistic,\" said Ellerbe. \"You can't just outlaw something because people die in it. You have to find ways to make it safer and that's what we're trying to do.\"\n\nMayweather Promotions is one of several major promoters who have pledged their support to the newly instituted rule. The move comes as a welcome development for many in the boxing community who feel that more must be done to protect fighters' safety.\n\n#  Nevada and Washington Move Forward with Age Restrictions for Casino Gaming\n\nThe states of Nevada and Washington have both approved measures that will place age restrictions on casino gaming. This comes as a response to concerns over gambling addiction amongst minors.\n\nIn Nevada, the new law stipulates that players must be at least 21 years of age in order to gamble in a casino. This replaces the previous minimum age threshold of 18. Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval commented on the change, saying that it would help to protect minors from the dangers of gambling addiction.\n\nWashington has also passed a measure that will set the minimum age for casino gaming at 21. However, this law will not take effect until June 1st, 2019. The delay is reportedly due to concerns over how the change will impact tribal casinos.\n\nBoth Nevada and Washington are amongst a growing number of states that have imposed age restrictions on casino gaming. Others include New Jersey, Illinois, Indiana, and Louisiana.\n\n#  Mayweather Promotions Welcomes New 25-and-Older Rule in Washington\n\n# Mayweather Promotions is elated to annouce the new 25-and-older rule in Washington. As of January 1, 2018, all boxers who have competed in a professional match must be 25 years or older.\n\n# \"This new rule is a major victory for our company and for the sport of boxing,\" said CEO of Mayweather Promotions, Leonard Ellerbe. \"It will help to ensure that only the most qualified boxers are able to compete at the professional level, and that the safety of our athletes is always our top priority.\"\n\n# The decision to enact this rule was made in light of recent tragedies in the sport of boxing, such as the death of Russian boxer Maxim Dadashev. In response to these tragedies, lawmakers and regulators around the country are taking a closer look at the regulation of combat sports. This new rule is one step towards ensuring that boxing is as safe as possible for athletes at all levels.\n\n# Mayweather Promotions has been a leader in promoting safe and fair boxing matches since its inception. The company has a strong track record of promoting bouts between experienced boxers who are well-matched in terms of size and skill. With this new rule in place, Mayweather Promotions will continue to put on the highest quality matches while ensuring the safety of its athletes.","source":"_posts/Mayweather-Promotions-CEO-Leonard-Ellerbe-Supports-New-25-and-Older-Rule-in-Washington.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Mayweather Promotions CEO Leonard Ellerbe Supports New 25 and Older Rule in Washington\ndate: 2022-10-27 16:44:01\ncategories:\n- Microgaming\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  Mayweather Promotions CEO Leonard Ellerbe Supports New 25-and-Older Rule in Washington\n\nWashington D.C. lawmakers have proposed a new rule that would restrict promoters from staging boxing matches in the district for anyone under the age of 25.

The bill, nicknamed the “Mayweather Rule” after Floyd Mayweather’s successful match against Conor McGregor last year, is designed to protect young fighters and give them more time to develop their skills.</p>\n<p>The proposal has been met with mixed reactions. Some people argue that it will help keep young fighters safe, while others believe that it will stunt their growth and keep them from competing against the best in their class.</p>\n<p>Leonard Ellerbe, CEO of Mayweather Promotions, is one of the bill’s supporters. He believes that it will help young fighters stay out of danger and give them a chance to learn the sport properly.</p>\n<p>“There’s nothing like learning on the job,” Ellerbe said in an interview with The Associated Press. “But you don’t want someone learning on the job when they’re taking punches from somebody who’s a world champion.”</p>\n<p>Mayweather himself agrees with Ellerbe, and has even lent his support to the bill.</p>\n<p>“Our sport is all about giving younger athletes an opportunity to showcase their talent, and this legislation will do just that,” Mayweather said in a statement released by his company. “I’m proud to support it.”</p>\n<p>Other notable promoters, including Bob Arum of Top Rank and Lou DiBella of DiBella Entertainment, are also in favor of the new rule.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Washington-Becomes-Second-State-to-Enact-25-and-Older-Rule-for-Casino-Gaming\"><a href=\"#Washington-Becomes-Second-State-to-Enact-25-and-Older-Rule-for-Casino-Gaming\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Washington Becomes Second State to Enact 25-and-Older Rule for Casino Gaming\"></a>Washington Becomes Second State to Enact 25-and-Older Rule for Casino Gaming</h1><p>Washington has become the second state to enact a 25-and-older rule for casino gaming, following in the footsteps of Illinois. The move is meant to curb problem gambling among younger adults, who are more prone to developing such addictions.</p>\n<p>Under the new rule, casino players must be at least 25 years old in order to gamble at venues in the state. There are some exceptions for those who are accompanying a parent or legal guardian, but as a general rule, only those over 25 will be able to gamble in Washington casinos.</p>\n<p>The decision was made after months of research and public consultation by the Washington State Gambling Commission (WSGC). In their report, the commission noted that problem gambling rates were highest among those aged 18 to 24, with nearly 2 percent of this age group having a serious problem.</p>\n<p>“We believe that this change will help reduce the number of people whose lives are adversely affected by gambling addiction,” said WSGC Chair Richard Daynard in a statement.</p>\n<p>The new rule is set to take effect on January 1st, 2020. It will apply to all of Washington’s 24 casinos, as well as its various racetracks and card rooms.</p>\n<p>Illinois was the first state to enact a 25-and-older rule for casino gaming back in 2017. Since then, several other states have followed suit, including New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Michigan.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Mayweather-Promotions-CEO-on-New-25-and-Older-Rule-in-Washington-It’s-the-Right-Thing-to-Do\"><a href=\"#Mayweather-Promotions-CEO-on-New-25-and-Older-Rule-in-Washington-It’s-the-Right-Thing-to-Do\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Mayweather Promotions CEO on New 25-and-Older Rule in Washington: It’s the Right Thing to Do\"></a>Mayweather Promotions CEO on New 25-and-Older Rule in Washington: It’s the Right Thing to Do</h1><p>On Thursday, the Washington State Athletic Commission voted unanimously to institute a new rule prohibiting any boxer who has turned 25 years old from competing in the state. The move is a response to the death of fighter Patrick Day, who was 27 when he died after being knocked out in November.</p>\n<p>“We don’t want to see anyone die in the ring,” said Mayweather Promotions CEO Leonard Ellerbe in support of the new rule. “This is something that we’ve been pushing for and it’s the right thing to do.”</p>\n<p>Day’s death has renewed calls for reform in boxing, including greater regulation of weight classes and concussion prevention measures. But while some have called for an outright ban on professional boxing, Mayweather Promotions believes that such a measure would only push the sport further underground.</p>\n<p>“We have to be realistic,” said Ellerbe. “You can’t just outlaw something because people die in it. You have to find ways to make it safer and that’s what we’re trying to do.”</p>\n<p>Mayweather Promotions is one of several major promoters who have pledged their support to the newly instituted rule. The move comes as a welcome development for many in the boxing community who feel that more must be done to protect fighters’ safety.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Nevada-and-Washington-Move-Forward-with-Age-Restrictions-for-Casino-Gaming\"><a href=\"#Nevada-and-Washington-Move-Forward-with-Age-Restrictions-for-Casino-Gaming\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Nevada and Washington Move Forward with Age Restrictions for Casino Gaming\"></a>Nevada and Washington Move Forward with Age Restrictions for Casino Gaming</h1><p>The states of Nevada and Washington have both approved measures that will place age restrictions on casino gaming. This comes as a response to concerns over gambling addiction amongst minors.</p>\n<p>In Nevada, the new law stipulates that players must be at least 21 years of age in order to gamble in a casino. This replaces the previous minimum age threshold of 18. Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval commented on the change, saying that it would help to protect minors from the dangers of gambling addiction.</p>\n<p>Washington has also passed a measure that will set the minimum age for casino gaming at 21. However, this law will not take effect until June 1st, 2019. The delay is reportedly due to concerns over how the change will impact tribal casinos.</p>\n<p>Both Nevada and Washington are amongst a growing number of states that have imposed age restrictions on casino gaming. Others include New Jersey, Illinois, Indiana, and Louisiana.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Mayweather-Promotions-Welcomes-New-25-and-Older-Rule-in-Washington\"><a href=\"#Mayweather-Promotions-Welcomes-New-25-and-Older-Rule-in-Washington\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Mayweather Promotions Welcomes New 25-and-Older Rule in Washington\"></a>Mayweather Promotions Welcomes New 25-and-Older Rule in Washington</h1><h1 id=\"Mayweather-Promotions-is-elated-to-annouce-the-new-25-and-older-rule-in-Washington-As-of-January-1-2018-all-boxers-who-have-competed-in-a-professional-match-must-be-25-years-or-older\"><a href=\"#Mayweather-Promotions-is-elated-to-annouce-the-new-25-and-older-rule-in-Washington-As-of-January-1-2018-all-boxers-who-have-competed-in-a-professional-match-must-be-25-years-or-older\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Mayweather Promotions is elated to annouce the new 25-and-older rule in Washington.

Once there, press square to start a game, then immediately quit out of it. Next, head over to the poker table in Diamond Casino Resort, and press square again to start a game. Again, quit out of it as soon as it starts.</p>\n<p>Now, go back to the Roulette table, and you should still have the option to play again.
