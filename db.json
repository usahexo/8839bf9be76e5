founded Furman Rugby America","date":"2022-08-17T17:02:09.000Z","_content":"\n\n#  Who founded Furman Rugby America? \n\nThe Furman Rugby America team was founded in 2009 by Nic Lasher. His goal was to provide a competitive outlet for the college’s students, and the team has certainly accomplished that.\n\nFurman has enjoyed a great deal of success in its short history, thanks in large part to Coach Lasher’s leadership. The club has captured the Southern Conference Championship three times (2011, 2013, and 2016) and finished as runner-up twice (2012 and 2015). They have also fared well in national tournaments, earning a spot in the prestigious D1A National Championship Tournament twice (2013 and 2016). \n\nThis past season was arguably Furman’s best yet. The Paladins went undefeated in conference play, winning their fourth consecutive Southern Conference Championship. They then capped off their season with a trip to the D1A National Championship Tournament where they reached the semifinal round. \n\nCoach Lasher and his team have built Furman Rugby into one of America’s top collegiate rugby programs, and they show no signs of slowing down anytime soon.\n\n#  What are the Furman Rugby America colors? \n\nThe Furman Rugby America colors are white and green.\n\n#  What is the Furman Rugby America logo?\n\nThe Furman Rugby America logo is a simple, yet elegant design that incorporates the university’s Paladins mascot and blue and white colors. The logo was designed by graphic artist Carlton Wilder and first used in the early 1990s. The key elements of the logo are a shield with a paladin on horseback in the center, flanked by two rugby balls. The inscription “Furman Rugby America” is at the top of the shield, and “Paladins” is at the bottom.\n\nThe origins of the Furman Rugby America logo can be traced back to when rugby began to gain popularity on college campuses across the United States in the late 1980s. As rugby began to grow in popularity, universities started to create their own teams and develop their own logos. Furman University was no exception, and in 1990 they created a rugby team and commissioned graphic artist Carlton Wilder to create a logo for them.\n\nThe original version of the logo had a more intricate design, with a scrollwork border around the shield and a banner across the top with “Furman Rugby America” written on it. The paladin on horseback was also more detailed, with full armor and a flowing cape. However, over time this version of the logo began to be seen as too busy and was eventually replaced with the simpler design that is used today.\n\nDespite its simplicity, the Furman Rugby America logo has become one of the most recognized logos in collegiate rugby circles. It has been used extensively by Furman University both on their website and social media pages, as well as on merchandise such as T-shirts and hats. The Paladins have also used it on their playing jerseys, making it one of only a handful of American university rugby teams to do so.\n\n#  What is the Furman Rugby America mission? \n\n# The Furman Rugby America mission is to better the community through the sport of rugby. \n\nThe Furman Rugby America team was founded in 2013 as part of an effort to give back to the Greenville community. The team’s mission is to use the sport of rugby as a vehicle to make a positive impact on the lives of others. Whether it’s working with local schools or charities, the team is committed to using rugby as a way to help others. \n\nIn addition to its work in the Greenville community, the Furman Rugby America team also participates in tournaments across the country. The team has had success on the field, winning several tournaments and national championships. But more important than wins and losses is the work that the team does off of the field. The Furman Rugby America team is a force for good in the world, and it looks forward to making an even bigger impact in the years to come.\n\n#  What are the Furman Rugby America sponsors?\n\nThe Furman Rugby America sponsors are a group of businesses and organizations that have partnered with the Furman rugby program to provide financial and other support. The sponsors are critical to the success of the team, and their contributions help to offset some of the program's costs.\n\nSome of the largest contributors are title sponsor Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, as well as presenting sponsor MillerCoors Brewing Company. Other notable sponsors include Under Armour, KPMG, Ortho Carolina, and GE Healthcare. These companies all recognize the importance of developing leaders on and off the field, and they support Furman rugby as a means of achieving this goal.\n\nThe sponsorship program provides much-needed financial assistance to the team, but it also offers many other benefits. For example, sponsors have access to exclusive team events and can promote their brands through various marketing channels. In addition, they receive recognition on both the team website and social media platforms.\n\nThe Furman Rugby America sponsors are an important part of the program and their support is greatly appreciated. Thanks to their generosity, the team is able to continue its pursuit of excellence both on and off the field.","source":"_posts/Who-founded-Furman-Rugby-America-.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Who founded Furman Rugby America \ndate: 2022-08-18 01:02:09\ncategories:\n- Rugby Union\ntags:\n- lindenwood rugby\n- cipp usa rugby\n- rugby super\n- game rugby\n- rugby champions\n- rugby championships\n---\n\n\n#  Who founded Furman Rugby America? \n\nThe Furman Rugby America team was founded in 2009 by Nic Lasher.
